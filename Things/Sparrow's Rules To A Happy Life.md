# Sparrow's Rules (To A Happy Life)
Below are the rules that Sparrow has created in order to live a better life for themselves. These rules are almost never followed, but simply give the appearance that they are doing it for the betterment of themselves.

##### Rule 394: Don't sleep with acrobats.
	Following a long winded night of drinking, and a beautiful circus performance, Sparrow decided it would be a good idea to sleep with the acrobatics group. This was a bad idea, as they all expected them to be way more flexible in bed than they actually were. Their back was very sore for the next few days.
